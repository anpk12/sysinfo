This is a simple script for retrieving information
about the host system that the code (typically web
application) is running on, so that it can be
presented on a web page, and/or graphed over time.
Or perhaps it can be used to detect situations
where the system is running low on resources.

It is made as part of an online course in web
development. So I was forced to make this available
on github and packagist. Maybe it can be useful
for someone.
